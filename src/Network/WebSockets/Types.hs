-- apply:
--
-- * Natively, everything is represented as a 'BL.ByteString', so this is the
--   fastest instance
--
-- * You should only use the 'TL.Text' or the 'T.Text' instance when you are
--   sure that the data is UTF-8 encoded (which is the case for 'Text'
--   messages).
--
-- * Messages can be very large. If this is the case, it might be inefficient to
--   use the strict 'B.ByteString' and 'T.Text' instances.
